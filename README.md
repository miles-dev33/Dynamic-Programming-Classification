Project Description:
This project implements 3 main algorithms, the first being the character mode 
which calculates the most reoccurring character from the input of a vector of strings.
The next algorithm that it calculates is the longest mirrored string which checks to 
see which mirror string is the longest by storing a vector of the mirrored strings found
and returning the contents of the index containing the longest one. Finally, the last
algorithm that we are implementing in this project is the longest subset trio, which 
essentially finds the longest trio of words from a vector of N strings, and returns it.
